The 'describe' keyword is used to group related specs. Can be nested. Describes 
Specs are specified by the 'it' keyword. Specs are essentially tests.
There can be more than one expectation in an 'it'.
To exclude a test or set of tests, change 'describe' to 'xdescribe', or 'it' to 'xit'. Will set those specs to 'pending'.
Spies allow for spying, mocking and faking. A spy replaces the function it is spying on. Useful for testing async behavior that require callbacks by faking the async method call.
